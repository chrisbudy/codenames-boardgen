# A simple Codenames board generator

Quick and dirty app to faciliate generating boards and answer keys for the game [Codenames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)). I play this in Slack with co-workers, and only the people that owned the game could set it up. This app allows anyone to start a game.
